### Introduction

I'm currently a second year applied data science student studying at Monash University with an interest in various forms of programming and all forms of mathematics!

### What I program in

I have used Python and Wolfram Mathematica for an extensive period in various environments along with C++ for competitive programming competitions. Alongside those languages, I've used Rust for a major programming project, MATlab for numerical simulations and I am generally flexible to learning new languages. Data visualizations and cybersecurity are the main specialities that I work with, however I am adept at learning new technologies as required.

I'm open to any suggestions, collaborations or job opportunities!
